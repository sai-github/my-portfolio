## Development Environment 🛠

- Node.js `v16.13`
- React `v18.2`

## Features & Concepts 🚀

- **Design System**: Created a mini design system using Figma with neo-brutalist style.

- **Themes**: Implemented both light and dark themes. The site respects the initial theme preference of the user's system.

- **3D Models**: Utilized [Spline](https://spline.design) to create unique and engaging 3D models.

- **Personal Touches**: The site features a representation of my room and an airport scene from my visit to Toulouse, making the user experience more personal and unique.
