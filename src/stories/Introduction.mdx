<div className="subheading">Understanding Neo-brutalism</div>

Neo-brutalism is a design style that takes inspiration from architectural Brutalism, prioritizing ruggedness and straightforwardness over conventional beauty. With the advent of high-resolution screens and powerful rendering engines, this style is becoming increasingly popular in web and UI/UX design.

To learn more about Neo-brutalism, you can check out the following resources:

- [Neo Brutalist Websites](https://dribbble.com/tags/neo%20brutalism)
- [A Brief Overview of Brutalism in Web Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/brutalism-antidesign/)
- [Neubrutalism is taking over the web](https://hype4.academy/articles/design/neubrutalism-is-taking-over-web)

Some tech companies have also adopted the brutalist design philosophy in their products. For example, [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) incorporate aspects of brutalist design in their user interfaces.
